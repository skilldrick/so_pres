//Templates can process arbitrary expressions
//"But don't go overboard! There is not a complete JavaScript parser
//in the context of inline expressions in the template. If you have
//complex code, write a function, and call the function from your
//template, and pass parameters if you need to: ${myFunction(a,b)}"

//Debugging: you can do a console.log() in a template to find out
//what's going on there.

//As apps get more ajaxified, it makes sense for the server to just
//return JSON. Using templates like this means we can simplify
//the JavaScript needed to render that data, and keep the view
//code out of the JavaScript.
//
//Variables available within template:
//
//$: The jQuery object.
//
//$item: The current template item - which allows access to
//$item.data, $item.parent, etc. as well as any user-defined values
//or methods passed in with the options map.
//
//$data: The current data item (equivalent to $item.data).
//
//Note: A template tag with content such as {{each}}...{{/each}} may
//expose additional variables to template evaluation within the
//content. In the case of {{each}}, for example, the additional
//template variables $value and $index are provided within the
//content of the {{each}} tag.
